/*3: Convert RGB Color Values to Grayscale Using Bitwise Operations
Why Convert RGB to Grayscale?
In image processing, converting a colored image to grayscale simplifies the data, reducing complexity while preserving essential details. Grayscale images are widely used in:

Machine learning (e.g., OCR, face recognition)

Image compression

Edge detection algorithms

Understanding Grayscale Conversion
A grayscale value represents the brightness of a pixel without color. The standard formula for grayscale conversion is:

Gray=  0.3ùëÖ+0.59ùê∫+0.11ùêµ
        Gray=0.3R+0.59G+0.11B
where:

R (Red) contributes 30% of the brightness,

G (Green) contributes 59% (most dominant),

B (Blue) contributes 11%.

However, floating-point multiplication is computationally expensive. Instead, we approximate using bitwise operations, which are much faster.*/
